# SIT_DBMS
Ng Wee Yang Ryan, Parris Cheng, Edwin Ng Jun Yuan, Tee Wen Jun, Danyel Foo, and I collaborated on a DBMS project for a SIT module (EDE2104)

The project involves two phases, the first being the development of a SQL version, followed by the conversion of the SQL version into a NoSQL version. The queries for the SQL and NoSQL are written within the python scripts. 

The querying was integrated into a telegram bot to allow users to access this feature on their phones for convenience.
